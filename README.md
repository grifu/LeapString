Leap String (LeapIT)

LEAP IT – STRING is a simple application that allows you to share the hand motion data captured by the Leap Motion device using a network connection via OSC protocol with the fowling features:

– Record the performance
– Replay a recorded performance
– Select joints for broadcast
– Convert a recorded binary performance into a text file
– Hide/Show the GUI
– Convert the scale of the hand motion data
– Switch Palm Orientation between Pitch, Yaw, Roll or Yaw, Pitch, Roll

This application is a “string” from the Virtual Marionette Interaction Model developed by Luís Grifu for a research on digital puppetry. This application is free to use.

1-> Plug a Leap Motion device 

2-> Activate the features you want to send through OSC
